update.txt

This new file will be used to signal to the app when there has been an update to a build

Increase the number by one when there has been an update to your build

Line 1 = build number 1

Line 2 = build number 2

If the number in line 1 has a number 1 in it then change this to a 2 when you have uploaded a new update for build number one and the app will signal to the user that there has been an update for this build.

Images

Upload images for your builds to be displayed in your app.
image1.png = build number one
image2.png = build number two

and so on up to 10 builds

Image sizes are 300 x 300
