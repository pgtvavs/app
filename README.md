update.txt

This new file will be used to signal to the app when there has been an update to a build

Increase the number by one when there has been an update to your build

Line 1 = build number 1

Line 2 = build number 2

If the number in line 1 has a number 1 in it then change this to a 2 when you have uploaded a new update for build number one and the app will signal to the user that there has been an update for this build.

Images

Upload images for your builds to be displayed in your app.
Images 1 to 10 (image1.png to image10.png) will be displayed for the Kodi 16.1 side of your app and images 11 to 20 (image11.png to image20.png) will be displayed for the Kodi 17.1 side of your app. 

image1.png = build number one for older Android devices
image2.png = build number two for older Android devices
image11.png = build number one for newer Android devices
image12.png = build number two for newer Android devices

and so on up to 10 builds and builds 20

Image sizes are 300 x 300

New version2.txt, location2.txt and update2.txt

These flies work in the exact same way as the current system but are for Kodi 17.1 side of the app (newer Android devices)

Newer Android devices = Android OS 5.0 or higher
Older Android devices = Android OS lower than 5.0
